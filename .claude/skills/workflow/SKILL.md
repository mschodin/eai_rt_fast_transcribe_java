RAPID Workflow
──────────────────────────────────────

Getting Started:
  1. Bootstrap — describe your app in one big prompt,
     let Claude build the foundation (routing, auth, DB, CI, deploy)
  2. Then use the pipeline below to add features one at a time

Pipeline:
  1. Define       /open-issue <desc>     Clarifying Qs → GitHub issue with ACs
  2. Design       (automatic)            Architect agent → design doc in docs/designs/
  3. Implement    /feature <STORY-ID>    Feature branch → slice-by-slice code
  4. Review       /review                Quality gates → code review
  5. Ship         (automatic)            Commit → PR → CI checks
  6. Iterate      /fix-ci [run-id]       Fix failures, re-run /review until green

Other Commands:
  /fix-issue <number>    Fix a GitHub issue end-to-end
  /investigate <url>     Browser inspection (screenshots, console, network)
  /sdlc                  Pipeline status dashboard
  /workflow              This help message
